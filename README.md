Credit risk management refers to managing the probability of a companyâ€™s losses if its borrowers default on repayment. Its main purpose is to reduce the rising quantum of non-performing assets from the customers and to recover the same in due time with appropriate decisions. It is observed that due to the high probability of default a lot of business owners are denied Loans without a thorough investigation into their financial life. The financial game of lending is thus based on the assets one owes and who he or she knows. On the other hand, business owners find it difficult to transact with these financial institutions due to the vulnerability of their working system.


Proposed Solution
Our solution Is to use AI tools in determining the risk credibility of the customer, by analyzing his or her financial transactions and behavioral patterns. In matters of security, we are to use blockchain technology to enable the distribution and recording of digital content without its editing. A blockchain serves as the basis for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be changed, removed, or destroyed. Recent studies on the management of client databases in Africa have revealed that these databases are not totally safe and transparent.
